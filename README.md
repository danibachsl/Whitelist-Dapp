# Whitelist-Dapp

IÂ´m launching my NFT collection named `Crypto Devs`. I want to give my early supporters access to a whitelist for my collection, so here I am creating a whitelist dapp for `Crypto Devs`

## Requirements

- Whitelist access should be given to the first `10` users for free who want to get in.
- There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

## Build

### Smart Contract

To build the smart contract I used [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

### Website

- To develop the website I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.
